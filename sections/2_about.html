    <div class="bluevar">MY STORY</div>
      <p>
        My full name is Bryce Joseph Powell-Chimene, and I was born on December 3, 2001, to my parents, Jessica Powell-Chimene and Joe Chimene. I grew up in Dayton, Texas, with my three older brothers and was always engaged in sports, primarily American football, and occasionally basketball. My fascination with technology began with competing in video games with my brothers, but it wasn't what ultimately led me to choose everything technology as a career.
        <br><br>
        My interest in technology began when my brother was taking multiple computer classes in high school. At the time, I was solely focused on sports, but I was also intrigued by the inner workings of computers, often watching him create apps at home. This sparked my curiosity, leading me to enroll in as many computer classes as possible during high school. From there, I developed a passion for coding and creating things from scratch.
        <br><br>
        I graduated from Texas Lutheran University in May 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I am now focused on expanding my knowledge and expertise in the technology field. My long-term goal is to become a leading software engineer, contributing to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology and positively impact the world.

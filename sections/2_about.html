    <div class="bluevar">MY STORY</div>
      <p>
        My full name is Bryce Joseph Powell-Chimene and I was born on December 3rd, 2001 to my mother Jessica Powell-Chimene, and father Joe Chimene. I grew up in Dayton, Texas alongside three older brothers and was always playing a sport. Usually, it was American Football but if not that then it was basketball. Technology was always a fascination to me since I enjoyed competing with my brothers in video games but thats not what officially made my decision with the software engineering.
        <br><br>
        It started when my brother was taking multiple computer classes in high-school and I was just an athlete at the time so all I cared about was sports but I was also interested with the inner workings of computers because I have always watched my brother make apps at home. Therefore a decision was made and I also was taking all the computer classes I could in high-school. From then on I built a passion for coding and creating things from scratch.
        <br><br>
        I now attend Texas Lutheran University and will be graduating in may of 2024, where I will then pursue to attain a Software-Engineer occupation. With that said my long-term goal with this job acquired is to continue learning about code and retire as a Senior Software-Engineer.
